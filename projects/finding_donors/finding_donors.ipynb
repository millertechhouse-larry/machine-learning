    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Based on my initial evaluation, it is clear that the decision tree model is the best model for this data.  The accuracy and F-score on the test data when the full training set is used is very close to that of the KNeighbors model, but the training and prediciton times are much less.  The prediciton time is especially insignificant compared to KNeighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that a decision tree classifier could be constructed that would produce a higher accuracy and F-score than the default one used in this comparison.  The reason I believe this is that accuracy and F-score on the training data are significantly higher than they are on the test data set.  This indicates that the model knows the test data very well, but does not generalize well on unseen data.  I believe that some adjustments that would improve the model's ability to generalize could be made such as limiting the depth and specifying a minimum number of points at the leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the GaussianNB classifier did not perform as well as the other models.  It improved significantly as the data set increased, but with the size of the data set that we have it did not perform as well as the other models that I chose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting observation is that the KNeighbors model took longer to train than the other models, which is contrary to my assumption.  Evidently, the overhead of setting up the database of points for KNeighbors is more than the training time for the other two highly efficient models."

    "The decision tree classifier attempts to determine the classification of a given data point by applying a series of decisions that are determined through training.  The decision at each node will attempt to divide the data that falls onto that node into the >50K or <=50K classification based on a particular feature.  The training algorithm will determine which feature and which decision based on that feature at each node will provide the highest information gain.  Another way to say this is that each decision splits the data into two more organized, easier to classify groups.  The highest information gain from a particular decision node would split the data into one group with all >50K data points and the other one with all <=50k points.  It is rare that it is ever possible to split a dataset based on one feature, so the decision tree has progressive nodes which each produce a slightly more organized data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree model can have a tendency to overfit the data, which means it memorizes the training set and doesn't make reasonable predictions on unseen data points.  Therefore, it is often necessary to limit the depth of the decision tree, or to specify a minimum number of training data points at the leaf nodes.  Limiting the depth means that there is a limited number of times that the model will attempt to split the data before it makes a classification.  Specifying the minimum number of points at the leaf nodes means that the model will not attempt to split a group of data points that is smaller than a certain amount.  Instead, it will take the most common classification of the points that are at that node.  In other words, the points at the final node will \"vote\" on the classification."

    "Three out of the five features that I expected to be the most important agreed with the most important features identified by the random forest classifier.  The random forest classifier model identified age as the most relevant feature, which makes sense because salaries tend to be higher for more experienced people across industries and types of jobs.  Capital gain was identified as the third most relevant feature, which aligns with my initial assumption.  Education-num is the fifth most relevant feature, which is not as high as I expected.  However, I can beleive this since the value of education varies a lot with the field.  For instance, an undergraduate degree in engineering often leads to a higher salary than a graduate degree in arts.  Not surprisingly, the education-num feature which assigns an \"analog\" value to the education and wraps all types of education into a single value was more useful to the algorithm than the \"digital\" values for each individual type of education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two values that I did not expect to be highly relevant were in the top five features.  One of those is hours per week, which was the second most relevant feature.  I did not expect hours per week to be highly relevant because I assumed that most high paying jobs have a 40-hour work week, but this assumption is either incorrect or doesn't lead to a direct impact on classifying people as making more or less than \\$50K.  Additionally, the relationship_husband feature was the fourth most relevant feature.  Although I didn't expect this, I can see a few reasons why this would be relevant.  The first is that this implies that the person is male and it is a well-known (although unfortunate) fact that men are paid more than women on average.  Additionally, people sometimes wait to get married until they are more mature or have saved up some money, which would generally happen when a person is older or making more money.  Finally, a husband who needs to support a wife and children would have more motivation to find a high paying job than an unmarried person.\n",
    "\n",
    "I expected that the work class and occupation would be part of the five most relevant features, but they were not.  They are likely not completely irrelevant, but clearly these do not have the same impact as the five features that are discussed above."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
